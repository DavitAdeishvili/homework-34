    <h1>What is Web server?</h1>
    <p> A web server is like a special computer that stores websites and delivers them to people when they want to see them. When you type a website address (like www.example.com) into your browser, it sends a request to the web server. The web server then sends back the website's files and data, which your browser uses to show you the website on your screen. It's basically the middleman that helps you see and use websites on the internet.
