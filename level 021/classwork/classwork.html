            <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the</p> <p>English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called "football" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas </p> <p>people usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia,[8] Canada,</p> <p>South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[9] and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first  <p>two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, "football" has been gaining prevalence, despite   </p><p>the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football.[16] This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han dynasty.[17] Cuju players would pass the ball around, again having to avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a circular goal atop 10-11 meter poles.[18] During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[19] Although Fifa suggests there is no indication of any direct link between Cuju and association football, Cuju and other ancient games demonstrate humanity’s innate predisposition to play with a ball.[20] The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju, especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[21] Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.[22][23] Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.[24] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals".</p>

            <h2>gameplay</h2>
            <p>Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference,[94] known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.</p>
