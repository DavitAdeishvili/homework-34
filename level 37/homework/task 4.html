    <!--RGB means R-red, G-green, B-blue it goes 0-255 (its 16,777,216 colors in the world so it is so hard to make that many names for colors so it is made with numbers) rgb system works like that -- in first number we tell how many numbers of red do we need in second number we tell the program how many number of green we need and in third we tell the program how many number of blue do we need and with that combination it makes colors that can be similar to each other. program uses additional system that means that is we mix two or more colour it gets lighter and lighter-->
    <!--hex is so similar to rgb hex means 16 and its that number because we can use 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F the lowest is 0 and highests are F and 9-->
